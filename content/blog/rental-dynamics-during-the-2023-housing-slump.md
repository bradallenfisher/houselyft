Economists anticipate that in 2023, the rental market will serve as a refuge for many who are priced out of buying. Key predictions for the **rental market** dynamics through to **2024** include:
  - An increase in rental demand as **mortgage interest rates** make buying less accessible.
  - A potential tightening in the availability of rental units, leading to competition among renters.
  - Landlords may face challenges with affordability causing a push for rent-controlled or stabilized units to alleviate pressure on **homebuyers** and maintain fair housing practices.

### Navigating Rental Investments

Those considering rental property investments must analyze key factors such as **housing inventory**, local **economic conditions**, and **mortgage interest rates** to make informed decisions.
